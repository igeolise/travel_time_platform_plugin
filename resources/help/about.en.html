<h1>Travel Time Platform plugin for QGIS</h1>

<p>The TravelTime API helps users find locations by journey time rather than using <i>as the crow flies</i> distance. Time-based searching gives users more opportunities for personalisation and delivers a more relevant search.</p>

<p>The plugin is under active developpement, and currently only provides access to the Time Map feature.</p>

<p>Please visit our website to <a href="https://www.traveltimeplatform.com/">learn more about the platform</a> or to <a href="http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/overview/introduction">learn more about the API</a>.</p>
