This is the repository for the Travel Time Platform plugin for QGIS.

This plugin intends to make the Travel Time Platform API available for ues in QGIS through processing algorithms.

## Installation

Once released, this plugin will be available in the official QGIS repository.

In the meantime, you need to download the repository as zip a file and install it manually from the plugin manager.

## Usage

To use the plugin, you first need to [get an API key](http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/overview/getting-keys/). Enter the app ID and your API key in the configuration dialog.

Once this is done, you can use the algorithms from the processing toolbox. Please refer to [the API documentation](http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/reference/time-map/) for detailed instructions.

## Bug reports

Please report any issue to the bug tracker.

## Limitations

Currently, only the
[Time Map endpoint](http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/reference/time-map/) is implemented.

Currently, only 10 searches can be made per API query.

## Development

To update the translations :

```
# Update the translations files
pylupdate5 i18n/travel_time_platform.pro

# Make modifications to *.ts files either manually or using QtLinguist

# Regenerate the .qm files
lrelease i18n/travel_time_platform_fr.ts
```

Note : under Windows, make sure you installed `qt5-devel` and `qt5-tools` (using osgeo4w installer) and run the above commands from the `OSGeo4W shell`. You will need to setup the shell for qt5 and python3 by running `o4w_env`, `qt5_env` and `py3_env` beforehand.
