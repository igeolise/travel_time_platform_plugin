<h1>Getting an API key</h1>

<p>You need to get an API key to be able to use the Travel Time Platform. Getting an API key is free.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/overview/getting-keys/">Get a free API key</a></p>

<p>Once you have your key, head to the settings panel and enter the key. You may also enable an API usage alert, to avoid using all of your quota without noticing.</p>

<p><a href="#show_config">Open the settings panel</a></p>

<p>Be careful ! The API only supports up to 10 searches. This means that if your input layer contains more than 10 points, several queries will be made in batch. This may very quickly use your free API quota. So keep an eye on your usage from the settings dialog !</p>
